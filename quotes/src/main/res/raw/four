A selfish fox once invited a stork to dinner at his home and for a joke put nothing before her but some soup in a very shallow dish. The fox could easily lap this up, but the Stork could only wet the end of her long bill in it, and stayed hungry.
"I am sorry that the soup is not to your liking," said the fox with a sly smile.
"Oh, please do not apologise," said the Stork. "I hope you will return this visit, and come and dine with me too sometime." So a day was appointed when the Fox should visit the Stork.
Finally, when they were seated at the table, the Stork served them both some soup in a very long necked jar with a narrow mouth. The stork drank the soup easily but the fox could not insert his snout into the tall jar. This time it was the Fox’s turn to go hungry.
